## Nice to Meet You

My name is Tom, and I'm a web developer.

I started out as an independent consultant and Wordpress developer, eventually learning to build MVC web applications with CakePHP. A few years ago I fell in love with Ruby, and have been building Ruby on Rails based web applications ever since. 

I'm a hackathon enthusiast, open source contributor, previous speaker and teacher and a supporter of local development communities.

I love to learn and have been entirely self-taught since starting with BASIC and `help` commands. My dream is to never stop growing and developing my craft as a software writer.

You can find out more about me through the links on this page, or by sending me a message at [tom@thomashart.me](mailto:tom@thomashart.me)
