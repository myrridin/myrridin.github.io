## Hi! Nice to Meet You

My name is Tom, and I'm a web developer.

I started out as an independent consultant and Wordpress developer, eventually learning to build MVC web applications with CakePHP. A few years ago I fell in love with Ruby, and have been building Ruby on Rails based web applications ever since. I currently work at [Rosie](https://rosieapp.com){:target="_blank"}.

I'm a [hackathon enthusiast](https://medium.com/@hackupstate/the-people-behind-the-code-an-interview-with-tom-hart-aed7c2931352){:target="_blank"} and [organizer](https://hackfrost.devpost.com/){:target="_blank"}, open source contributor, previous speaker and teacher and a supporter of local development communities.

I love to learn and have been entirely self-taught since starting with BASIC and `help` commands. My dream is to never stop growing and developing my craft as a software writer.

You can find out more about me through the links on this page, or by sending me a message at [tom@thomashart.me](mailto:tom@thomashart.me)
